Cryptocurrency Prediction using LSTM and GRU


A simple Bidirectional LSTM and GRU model to predict cyptocurrency written in Google Colab.Look into the file Cryptocurrency_analysis.ipynb for detailed description.



We need to upload data before proceeding with the analysis. I used cryptocurrency data from Kaggle. 
Then we need to convert the timestamp into Date format followed by indexing and normalization of the dataset.
